Concurrency in Python
Concurrency is the ability of a program to deal with multiple tasks at once, but not necessarily simultaneously. It enables the program to make progress on one task while waiting for another task to complete (e.g., I/O operations).

In Python, concurrency is primarily achieved through:

Threads (multithreading)
Asyncio (asynchronous programming using async and await)

When to Use Concurrency?
You should use concurrency when:

Your program needs to handle I/O-bound tasks: operations that spend time waiting for external resources (e.g., reading/writing files, network requests, database queries).
You want to improve responsiveness and throughput of your application.
Tasks are independent and can be interleaved (switched between) to optimize waiting times.
Examples:

Web servers handling multiple client requests.
Making API calls to external servers.
Reading/writing to multiple files or databases concurrently.
